## Discovery

As SSDP defined, there are actually two kinds of discover message: searching and
advertising messages. Searching is used by device that wants to find other devices or
services that it has interests while advertising is used by any device that is willing to
announce it's presence on the network.

Yeelight smart LED supports both kinds of message. It will listen on a multi-cast address,
waiting for any incoming search requests. If the request is targeted for Yeelight smart LED
(ST header contains Yeelight pre-defined value), then the device will uni-cast a response to
the searcher. The response contains some basic information about the device, e.g. IP and
port of the control service, current power status, current brightness as well as all the
supported control methods. So when the searcher received the response, it can get the
basic idea of the device. With these information, it can do further contact and control. The
advertising message is sent by Yeelight smart LED after it joined the network or after a
fixed period of time (this is to refresh it's state). The message is sent to a multi-cast address
with some basic information. The receiver of the message should not respond to the
advertisement.
